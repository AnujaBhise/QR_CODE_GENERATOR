Initial SetUp (HTML Code):

The HTML page sets up a container 📦 that holds various elements.
Inside the container, there's a text input 🔤 where users can enter their text or URL. 
The QR code image will be displayed inside a container with an ID of "imgBox" 🖼️.
Initially, the image source is empty, so no QR code is displayed. 
There's also a button with the text "Generate QR Code" 🔄. 
When users click this button, the generateQR() function will be called.

JavaScript Function: generateQR()

When the button is clicked, the generateQR() function is executed. 
This function checks if the input field has any text entered 🕵️‍♂️. 
If there is text, it generates a QR code 📲 by updating the image source using an external service provided by qrserver.com.
It uses the user-entered text to create the QR code with the specified size. 
If the input field is empty, it temporarily adds an error class to the input field to indicate that there's an error 🚨. 
This class probably changes the input box's appearance. 
After a brief delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using setTimeout(), the error class is removed, making the input field look normal again 🕓.

In simple terms, this code allows users to enter some text or a URL. 
When they click the "Generate QR Code" button, it checks if there's any text entered. 
If there is, it creates a QR code image based on the text and displays it 🎉. 
If the input field is empty, it briefly shows an error message to remind users to enter something before generating the QR code ❌.
